Tutorial of AWH with FEP pulling

EPJ is a positively charged molecule and thus need to
be coupled with an additional chloride ion to be annihilated.

Step 1: Prepare the system
- modify the PDB file to move one of the chloride ions to the end of the first EPJ molecule
- modify the EPJ1.itp file to add the chloride ion. A flat-bottom restraint is added to keep the chloride ion away from the EPJ.
- modify the topol.top file

Step 2: Prepare the index file
- run through get_binding_site_epj.ipynb

Step 3: Run the simulation
- with awh_fep.mdp file
